Day 4: January 6, 2017 <br>
Progress: Worked through a tutorial on creating A Simple Web App With Node.js, Express, Bootstrap & Stormpath. Took a few times through to get everything working properly as this is fairly new work for me but in the end I was happy with the result. Will continue with node.js work as I hope to become proficient in using it. <br>
